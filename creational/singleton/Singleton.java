/*
Singleton pattern enforces only a single instance of a class to ever get produced and exist throughout an application's lifetime.
As an example, let's say we want to model the American President's official aircraft called "Airforce One" in our software.
There can only be one instance of Airforce One and a singleton class is the best suited representation.
