/*
A factory produces goods, and a software factory produces objects. Usually, object creation in Java takes place like so:

SomeClass someClassObject = new SomeClass();
The problem with the above approach is that the code using the SomeClass's object,
suddenly now becomes dependent on the concrete implementation of SomeClass.
There's nothing wrong with using new to create objects but it comes with the baggage of tightly coupling our code to the concrete implementation class,
which is a violation of code to an interface and not to an implementation.
