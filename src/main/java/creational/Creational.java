/*
Creational design patterns relate to how objects are constructed from classes.
New-ing up objects may sound trivial but unthoughtfully littering code with object instance creations can lead to headaches down the road.
The creational design pattern come with powerful suggestions on how best to encapsulate the object creation process in a program.

Builder Pattern
Prototype Pattern
Singleton Pattern
Abstract Factory Pattern

The builder pattern might seem similar to the abstract factory pattern but one difference is that the builder pattern creates an object step by step
whereas the abstract factory pattern returns the object in one go.
